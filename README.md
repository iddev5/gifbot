# gifbot

## What is it?

This is just a simple discord bot written in Python3 using Discord.py for learning about Discord API.  
I have not run the code from 10 months+ so I can't guarantee it would work or not.

## How to Use/Install  

First, go to discord developer portal and make a new bot app. Generate and copy the token.  
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iddev5/gifbot
pip install -U discord.py
cd gifbot
python3 gifbot.py
```
